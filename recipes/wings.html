      <li>
        24 chicken wing parts (12 wings separated into 2 pieces, drums and

      </li>
      <li>One 12-ounce bottle cayenne hot pepper sauce, such as Frank's</li>

      <li>Several dashes hot sauce, such as Tabasco</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- List of steps for recipe -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Heat 3 inches of canola oil in a
        heavy pot to 375 degrees F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half the chicken wing parts to the oil and fry them until they're
        golden brown and fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and drain on paper
        towels. Repeat with the other half of the wing parts. In a saucepan,
        heat the cayenne sauce and butter over medium-low heat. Add the
        Worcestershire and hot sauce. Let it bubble up, and then turn off the
        heat. Place the wings in an ovenproof dish and pour the hot sauce over
        the top. Toss to coat, and then bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
